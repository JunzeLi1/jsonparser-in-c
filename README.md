# Enhanced JSON Parser in CEnhanced JSON Parser in C

## 1. Project Description1. Project Description

Description:Description: This project provides a JSON parser that decodes JSON strings into a structured representation. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data
interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

The parser is designed to handle various JSON data types, including numbers, strings, lists, objects, booleans, and null. The project emphasizes the functionality of
parsing JSON objects, leveraging the concept of Binary Search Trees (BST) for optimized search operations.

## 2. Features2. Features

```
Parse JSON elements like integers, strings, lists, objects, booleans, and null values.
Ability to serialize parsed data back into JSON format.
Support for JSON files with trailing characters.
Advanced memory management to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal usage.
Use of a binary search tree for object representation, ensuring efficient data storage and access.
```
## 3. Technologies and Tools Used:3. Technologies and Tools Used:

```
Language:Language: C
Data Structures:Data Structures: Linked List, Binary Search Tree
Testing Framework:Testing Framework: Miniunit.h
Logging Library:Logging Library: Clog.h
```
## 4. Problem Statement and Usage:4. Problem Statement and Usage:

Problem:Problem: Conventional JSON parsers may lack the efficiency and comprehensive handling of all JSON elements. This project aims to address those inefficiencies by
developing a full-fledged parser that accurately and efficiently parses JSON data into structured C data types.

Potential Usage:Potential Usage: This JSON parser can be used in applications that involve:

```
Configuration settings management where settings are stored in JSON format.
Web servers and clients where JSON is a common data exchange format.
Data analytics tools for parsing large JSON datasets.
```
## 5. Challenges & Solutions:5. Challenges & Solutions:

Challenges:Challenges:

```
Handling different JSON types and their representations in C.
Efficiently storing parsed objects using a binary search tree.
Handling edge cases such as JSON files with trailing characters or escaped characters.
```
Solutions:Solutions:

```
Implemented specific parsing functions for each JSON type.
Used binary search trees for object representation, improving efficiency.
Incorporated conditions to check and handle edge cases ensuring parser robustness.
```
## 6. Optimization & Efficiency:6. Optimization & Efficiency:

The code has been optimized for performance and memory usage:

```
Memory Management:Memory Management: Careful handling of dynamic memory allocations to ensure no memory leaks.
Binary Search Tree:Binary Search Tree: For storing objects efficiently and ensuring O(log n) access times.
Whitespaces Handling:Whitespaces Handling: Efficiently ignores whitespaces outside of string literals.
Function Modularization:Function Modularization: Functions are broken down into smaller modules for better readability and maintenance.
```
## Detailed Explanation:Detailed Explanation:

```
1. Element Structure:Element Structure: The Element struct is designed to represent any valid JSON element. It uses a union to save memory space as only one of the union's
fields will be used at a time.
```
```
2. Binary Search Tree:Binary Search Tree: The project uses a BST for representing JSON objects. It allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
```
```
3. Parsing Functions:Parsing Functions: The parser includes distinct functions for parsing different JSON elements. Recursive strategies are employed for nested structures like
lists and objects.
```
```
4. Memory Management:Memory Management: The project carefully manages memory using the free_element() function to ensure that no memory leaks occur.
```
## 7. Testing & Reliability:7. Testing & Reliability:

```
Unit Testing:Unit Testing: The project uses the miniunit.h testing framework to perform unit tests on individual functions.
Code Coverage:Code Coverage: Ensures 100% code coverage, meaning every line and branch of the code has been tested.
Testing Functions:Testing Functions: The test_json.c file contains all the test cases and assertions for the JSON parser.
```
In summary, this JSON Parser provides an efficient and reliable method for parsing JSON data using C. Its advanced features like BST storage, comprehensive type
handling, and robust memory management make it a strong tool for any application involving JSON data processing.
